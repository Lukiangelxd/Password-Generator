# Password-Generator

## Description
This is designed to create a password for employees that are between 8 to 125 characters.

## Background
The password generator is the third assignment for UCONN's online Bootcamp. The main takeaway for this lesson is to create a website in browser that allows a user (employee) to create a password between 8 to 129 characters. These will include lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters. This will be asked through a series of prompts and displayed in the box after all prompts have been answered.

## User Story
```

I WANT to have an in browser password generator that can be used for employees based on a criteria stated in the background
SO I can showcase what I have knowledge of thus far in my studies
```
